I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block 

Given an action in natural language, I need to parse it into PDDL predicates.

### Example input 1:
pick up the orange block

### Example output 1:
['pickup',  'blue']


### Example input 2:
put down the red block

### Example output 2:
['putdown',  'red']


### Example input 3:
stack the red block on top of the yellow block

### Example output 3:
['stack',  'red', 'yellow']


### Example input 4:
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block

### Example output 4:
['unstack',  'blue', 'red']
