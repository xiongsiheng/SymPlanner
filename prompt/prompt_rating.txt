You will be provided with a goal, an initial block configuration, and a partial plan. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the partial plan based on:
- Whether the actions are valid and maintain consistency with the preconditions and postconditions.
- Whether the actions help achieve the goal, either directly or by setting up future beneficial moves.

You should DIRECTLY give a score from 1 to 10:
- 1: Invalid or counterproductive actions.
- 5: Neutral actions—valid but not helpful toward the goal.
- 10: Highly effective actions—valid and clearly beneficial for reaching the goal.
